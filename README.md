Analyzing Traffic Accident Data Overview This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. It aims to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

Dataset Dataset Source: US Accidents (2016 - 2020) Description: The dataset contains detailed information about traffic accidents in the United States, including factors such as location, weather conditions, road conditions, and time of occurrence. Project Structure Notebooks: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization. Data: Stores the dataset used for analysis. Visualizations: Includes visual outputs such as plots and maps generated from the analysis. README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project. Requirements Python 3.x Jupyter Notebook Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium (for maps) Installation Clone the repository:

bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-accident-analysis.git cd traffic-accident-analysis Install dependencies:
